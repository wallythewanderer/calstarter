I hate using lists. There is something fundamentally wrong with trying to keep track of events and tasks this way. Calendars win every day of the month in my book.
The goal of this project is to create a calendar that allows users to add events and tasks.
Events are set calendar items. Think doctors' appointments, soccer practices, etc. These have a defined start and end datetime, and are entered into the calendar as such.
Tasks are different; we treat tasks as deadlines, as events. This is not how they should be treated. They deserve better. Calstarter aims to help the user break down tasks into subtasks.
This is currently facilitated largely by the user by defining how many subtasks a particular task can be broken down into, describing those subtasks, and defining their length.
The program looks to automatically fill in slots where the user can complete the subtasks before the deadline. 
Future ideas involve AI integration that takes some of the weight off of the user in terms of creating and defining subtasks.
